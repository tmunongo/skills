## Overview

This Skill guides Claude to produce YouTube video scripts following a structured growth strategy. The creator focuses on technology, philosophy, cyberpunk aesthetics, human-technology interaction, and system-level critique (especially under late-stage capitalist incentives). Use this Skill whenever the user asks for YouTube scripting help, title/thumbnail optimization, audience framing, retention hooks, or structure based on defined core principles.

## When to Use

Apply this Skill when the user’s request involves:
- Writing or refining YouTube video scripts
- Generating titles, hooks, body structures, or CTAs
- Optimizing for viewer retention, clarity, and niche value
- Requests involving technology, philosophy, future impact, cyberpunk or socio-technical critique

## Core Principles

Time is finite for viewers; output must deliver measurable cognitive, philosophical, or tactical value.  
Define a precise niche and problem statement for each video topic.  
Weave creator identity into structure: tech-sceptical, systems-aware, reflective on human impact.  
Assess incentives and power dynamics where relevant (e.g., tech trends under late-stage capitalism).

## Script Structure Template

### THE PACKAGING
When scripting, first define:
1. Target niche (e.g., futurists who distrust mainstream tech narratives).
2. Specific problem this video solves (clarify cognitive value).
3. A curiosity-driven yet honest title and thumbnail concept that sets clear expectations.

### THE HOOK (First 60 seconds)
Deliver on the title quickly with a concise statement of insight.  
Identify the common belief and contrast it with the contrarian insight grounded in systems thinking.  
Preview the major points to justify the viewer’s time.

### THE BODY (Rising Value Loop)
Sequence persuasive, value-dense points so later points build on earlier ones.  
For each point:
- Context: Define the idea or trend.
- Application: Show how it manifests or can be used, with examples.
- Framing: Explain its impact on agency, society, incentives, or future trajectories.
Insert rehooks to maintain tension and narrative momentum.

### NATIVE EMBED & CTA
Identify a tactical pain point in the narrative and present an immediately useful resource (PDF, checklist, video).  
Encourage engagement by referencing how the script already delivered value.

### THE OUTRO
Summarize the conceptual journey and leave a final insight that reframes understanding or provokes further thought.  
End on a high, reflective note that aligns with the creator’s thematic identity.

## Examples (When Helpful)

Provide clear examples of outputs when:
- Generating hooks and titles (e.g., “Why This AI Hype Won’t Save You—and What Might”).
- Structuring bodies with rising insight loops.
- Embedding CTAs that feel like value extensions, not interruptions.

## Style and Voice

Maintain analytical clarity. Avoid verbosity.  
Challenge assumptions logically.  
Highlight incentives and systemic distortions.  

## Do Not Use This Skill For

Requests unrelated to YouTube scripting or content strategy.
